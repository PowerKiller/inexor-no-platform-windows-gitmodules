# inexor-no-platform-windows-gitmodules
A gitmodule file for people building inexor on non-windows so they don't need the platform windows module
DON'T EVER EVER EVER INIT THE SUBMODULES ON THIS REPO.
IF YOU EVER ACCIDENTALLY DON'T UPDATE THE SUBMODULES!!!
This is meant to be an other submodule file for Inexor... 
It's not meant to be a application or a makefile.. So no need of submodules here!!!!
And if you init the submodules it'll make a directory which is not required....
